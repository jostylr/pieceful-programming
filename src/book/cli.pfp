# The Command Line 

The program comes in two flavors: `pfp` is the lite version with minimal dependencies and minimal commands, hopefully the most useful commands common to most uses of this approach; `pieceful-programming` is the full version and contains the kitchen sink, one heavily skewed to web development. 

The most basic way to use this is `pfp fname1 fname2 ...` where the fnames are filenames with extensions of `.md` for markdown processing via commonmark or `.pfp` for processing via splitting on three dashed lines to get the code pieces.
