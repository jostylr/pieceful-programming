# PFP ( Pieceful Programming Lite )

This is a command-line client for doing pieceful programming. 

Install it with `npm install -g pfp-cli` or run it directly, locally, with `npx pfp-cli`. 

To run it on a file such as `sample.md` or `sample.pfp`, use `pfp sample.md` or `pfp sample.pfp`. 

The `.md` files are parsed using commonmark (markdown-based) while `.pfp` is a much simpler format intended for scripted writing, that is, writing a document with a little bit of computed processing in it. See documentation for more details [not done yet].
