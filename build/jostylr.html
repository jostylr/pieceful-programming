           Goodloe Poker is a poker variant that involves no betting, but a lot of lying.
          Essentially, one person gets a hand. They make a call, pass the hand
          along. If accepted, the next person must call something higher and
          the cycle repeats. If not accepted, then the hand is revealed. If it is lower than the called
          value, the player passing loses. Otherwise, the other player loses.
          After three losses, a player is out. Twos are wild.</p>
          <p> To play this game well, you need to know the poker hands, their
          ordering, and get a feeling for what is easy to improve and what is
          not. To train people to the necessary level, I created Goodloe
          Solitaire. This is a game whose sole purpose is to maximize one's
          score by improving the hand. The end of the game is when you decide
          to end it or one runs out of cards. It is simple, fast, and
          effective.

          celebrating your loved ones, we celebrate our enemies, our bugbears
          if you will. To do so, give them a lovely gift that is inappropriate
          in some way. This originated with

        <h2> My background </h2>
       <div id="background">   
          <p>
      A brief pertinent background is that I obtained a PhD from <a
          href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu"> Rutgers
          University</a> in mathematics
      on the topic of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-bohm/">
          Bohmian mechanics</a>, a theory of quantum mechanics.   I also dabble in differential geometry. On
      pleasant occasions, I get to dabble in both simultaneously. This is <a
          href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~oldstein">my advisor's page</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
      After a couple of
      years in academia (<a href="http://www.math.iastate.edu/">Iowa State
          University</a>, <a href="http://www.marymount.edu/academic/artandsci/math/">Marymount
          University</a>), I ended
      up teaching in a distance education program (<a href="http://www.cty.jhu.edu">Center for Talented Youth, Johns
          Hopkins University</a>) teaching
      very bright and gifted K-12 students who are eager to learn mathematics.
      It has been very enjoyable and educational. It has afforded me the
      opportunity to focus on mastering web technologies. I have taught the full range of high school mathematics course. 
      </p>
      <p> I left that program (though since have gone back to work part-time) in an effort to focus on my projects and to raise my daughter.
      </p>
      <p>
      As for computers, when I was young I had extensive interactions with
      them and was a natural programmer. But during my college and graduate
      years, I lacked a computer (portable computers were not too good in those
      days and I hate clunky desk ones). But once I obtained one again, I
      learned Perl followed by Javascript and PHP. These languages are
      extremely nice to program in and their power is amazing.
