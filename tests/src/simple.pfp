This is a first attempt
--- yaml
a: 3
b: [2, 3, 4]
--- main
Let's discuss _"topic" but we need _"b" and _"cool.js"
--- topic.js
Something and _":more"
--- :more | sub(another, one more) :=> log 
And another thing. 
--- cool.js.
This should have name cool.js
--- 
This does not get included. This is how to include comments. Notice the space after the three dashes.
--- cool.js.
cool.js again
---
This is included.
---\ not a heading. expect slash next, then no slash
---\
---\ 
---\\ One slash
---\\\ Two slashes
--- :=> log
--- end
Nothing to see here
